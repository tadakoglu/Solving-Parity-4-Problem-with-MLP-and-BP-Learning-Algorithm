# Solving-Parity-4-Problem-with-MLP-and-BP-Learning-Algorithm
I haved solved the Parity-4 problem using an artificial neural network called Multilayer Perceptron and populer learning algorithm Backpropagation algorithm. Sigmoid has been used as an activation(transfer) function .

You must start the app with ParityNStart.m file in MATLAB. If MATLAB have a hard time to start parityNStart, 
you may have to shorten this dictionary name. It only should include English characters without any blanks. Best Regards.
